title: 'How to Price Software: Find the Right Balance'
---

When pricing your software, you want to find the right balance between making it enticing for people to try it and not being too expensive for them to ever consider. You don't want to price your software so high that people are unwilling to even take a chance on it, but you also don't want to set the price so low that you give people the idea that your software is low quality.


A good way to price software is by offering a free trial period. This helps get users interested in seeing what you have, but it also gives them an opportunity to see if they really want or need the full version of your product and ultimately makes more sales because they already know how awesome your software is.


Finding the right price for your software can be tricky, but it's definitely worth taking the time to get it right. With a little experimentation and some tweaking, you'll be able to set a price that will have people clamoring to try out your product!


Keep in mind:


Price your software in a way that entices people to try it, but isn't too expensive for them to ever consider.


Offer a free trial period to help people get interested and see if they want the full version of your product.


Make sure you are set up to tweak your your price until you find the right balance that makes people clamor to try out your software! This means having a system in place that is flexible and agile enough to keep up with pricing and packaging changes.


Happy Pricing! :)
