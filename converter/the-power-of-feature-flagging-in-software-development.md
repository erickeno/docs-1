title: The power of feature flagging in software development
---

**Feature Flagging** is a common strategy for software developers in order to release features at a certain pace. A developer might not want all their code to be seen by a user until it's ready, which they can control through the use of the flags. They also help when rolling back features that may have had some bugs or issues, and provide a way for developers to test out new features before releasing them to the public.
