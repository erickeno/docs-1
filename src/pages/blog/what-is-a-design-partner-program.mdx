**Customer design partner programs** are a great way for you to get early feedback on your products from potential customers.

**A Design Partner Program is an early access program with a prioritization feedback loop**. That means you can rapidly implement features for customers who will test them and actively suggest new requirements that they think they would have as a (full) paying customer.

This is different from a Beta or Preview program because you must choose your design partners carefully. You are making a commitment to them, and in return they are committing their time and attention to you.
