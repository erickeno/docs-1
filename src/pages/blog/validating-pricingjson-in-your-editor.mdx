This is a quick guide for adding the schema for
[`pricing.json`](/docs/pricing.json) files to
vim and VSCode.

## TL;DR

The schema for `pricing.json` files is available at
[our docs](/docs/pricing.schema.json). Plug that URL into
whatever tool you use to validate JSON, and associate it with
`pricing.json` files.

## VS Code

More info on editing JSON is available [in the VSCode
docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json).

1. Open the [User and Workspace
   Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)
   menu.
2. Click `Extensions` and then `JSON` in the left sidebar.
3. Look for the option "JSON > Schema Download: Enable" and ensure
   that the box is checked.
4. Underneath that, look for the option "JSON: Schemas" and click
   "Edit in settings.json"

1. Add the following section:

```json
 "json.schemas": [
   {
     "fileMatch": ["pricing.json"],
     "url": "https://www.tier.run/docs/pricing.schema.json"
   }
 ],

```

Here's the result:

## vim/neovim and COC

If you use vim with [COC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim),
you can add support for validating pricing.json files like so:

1. Ensure that `coc-json` is enabled. You can do this by
   running `:CocInstall coc-json` or by having something like the
   following in your `~/.vimrc`:

```bash
 let g:coc_global_extensions = ['coc-json']
```

2. Run `:CocConfig` to option the configuration file for coc.
   (By default this is `~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json`.)
3. Add the following field to the object there (if it already
   exists) or add it as a new top level object:

```json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["pricing.json"],
      "url": "https://www.tier.run/docs/pricing.schema.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here's what it looks like in action:

That's it!
