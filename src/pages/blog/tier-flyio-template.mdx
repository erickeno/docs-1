A community member has contributed a Fly.io template. (Thank you [Samuel Gordalina](https://github.com/gordalina)!)

This template will provision Tier as a private service on [Fly.io](https://fly.io).

## Setup

Create an app out of [this template](https://github.com/gordalina/fly-tier).

```bash
sh flyctl launch --no-deploy
```

Then we set the stripe api key secret, and deploy it

```bash
sh flyctl secrets set STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_live_...
```

## Usage

The app is now available internally at `http://<app>.internal/`.

## Support
