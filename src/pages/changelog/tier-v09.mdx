We're excited to announce the release Tier 0.9.0, which brings several new features and improvements to our API.

## New Features

**Listing Payment Methods**

The new, experimental, `/v1/payment_methods?org=org:acme` API returns all payment methods associated with an org. It can be used with the latest addition to the `/v1/subscribe` endpoint to associate a payment method with an orgs subscription managed by Tier.

**Subscription Payment Methods**

Clients may now specify a payment method other than a customer's default payment method for the Tier managed subscription using the `/v1/subscribe` endpoint.

Use subscription-specific payment methods to avoid conflicts with other subscriptions that may have already or may later exist in your Stripe account that Tier does not manage.

**Require Billing Address with Checkout**

Users may now require a billing address when using Checkout. The Go SDK has been updated with a new `RequireBillingAddress` option on Checkout, and the CLI now accepts `--require_billing_address` as a flag to the subscribe sub command.

### Bug Fixes

Tier 0.9.0 also includes some bug fixes, the most notable is a fix for canceling subscriptions without active schedules. Canceling a subscription no longer requires the subscription to have an active schedule.

We hope that these changes improve your experience with our product. Please let us know if you have any questions or feedback.

The v0.9.0 release is here: [Tier Releases](/releases).

As always, please let us know if anything doesnâ€™t work as expected by filing issues at [our Github Issues](/issues/new).
