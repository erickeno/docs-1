You can [find the Tier CLI v0.6 here](http://github.com/tierrun/tier/releases/tag/v0.6.0).

The v0.6 release introduces a way to manage customer data stored in stripe for any Tier managed org.

To set the _email_, _description_, _name_, _phone_, or _user-defined metadata_, for an org, set the new `info` field for `/v1/subscribe` request. In addition to this change, a minimum of one phase for a `/v1/subscribe` request is no longer required.

The new fields are:

- description
- name
- phone
- email
- metadata

Additionally, the `/v1/whois` endpoint will now report up-to-date attributes if the query parameter `include=info` is present.

Both [the Go and Node SDKs have been updated](/docs/sdk/).

Please head over to [Releases](/releases) to check out more changes and install options. As always, `brew upgrade tierrun/tap/tier` works too!
